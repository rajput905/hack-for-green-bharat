# GreenFlow AI: Business Strategy & Market Validation

## 1. The Core Problem
Industrial zones and smart cities in India face a **climate data vacuum**. Current monitoring is often fragmented, delayed, or non-actionable.
- **Urgency**: India loses $210B annually due to climate-related risks (World Bank).
- **Regulation**: SEBI’s **BRSR (Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting)** now mandates ESG disclosure for top 1,000 listed companies.
- **The Pain**: Non-compliance leads to fines, environmental degradation, and health crises (e.g., Delhi smog).
